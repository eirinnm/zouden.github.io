## Totem: An interactive LED staff

This is a hobby project to build a motion-activated LED staff for festivals. The staff is made from a clear acrylic tube, 22mm ID and 26mm OD and 1m long. There are 104 addressable LEDs on a strip coiled around an inner acrylic tube (12/16mm). In the base of the staff there is a USB power bank connected to the PCB which contains through-holes for an Arduino nano, MPU-6050 breakout board, and screw terminal blocks. The terminals connect to the LED strip and to a push-on, push-off button in the top of the staff. There are wires running through the inner tube to connect the button to the PCB in the base. The end caps are 3D printed.

Later versions of this staff will use a single PCB with microcontroller and accelerometer on board, but this was easier to prototype. 

The software uses FastLED and Jeff Rowberg's i2cdevlib library for the MPU6050. The basic operation is that acceleration (in any direction) turns on the first LED (at the base) and the pitch (rotation) of the staff determines the colour. The colour is then copied up the length of the strip creating a fast-moving pulse. Twisting the staff changes the colour of the pulse and if it's done fast enough, a rainbow effect can appear.

The power supply is a Panasonic 18650 3400mAh, in a cylindrical power bank, and lasts for 8+ hours. It can be swapped by replacing the power bank in-situ. I'm not fully satisfied with this solution because the power bank's boost circuitry is wasting a lot of power. Later versions will bypass it by adding my own lipo circuitry to the board (ie, TP4056).
